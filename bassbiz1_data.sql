Recently, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published discussion paper on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) in which it is suggested that they are looking at developing &ldquo;rules to prevent BEPS by moving intangibles among group companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will involve:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>adopting a broad and clearly delineated definition of intangibles;</li>\r\n	<li>ensuring that profits associated with the transfer and use of intangibles are appropriately allocated in accordance with (rather than divorced from) value creation;</li>\r\n	<li>developing transfer pricing rules or special measures for transfer of hard-to-value intangibles; and</li>\r\n	<li>updating the guidance on cost contribution arrangements.&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, identification of intangibles and payments therefore has assumed very high importance in the area of transfer pricing and international taxation. The OECD defines the term &ldquo;intangible&rdquo; as &ldquo;something which is not a physical asset or a financial asset, and which is capable of being owned or controlled for use in commercial activities&rdquo;. This term remained undefined under the Indian tax laws for a long time. By an amendment introduced in 2012 the term &ldquo;intangible property&rdquo; was defined in the Income-tax Act, which is quite broad in scope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Royalty is payment for the use of or right to use an intangible. Normally, an intangible is crucial for a group when it attempts to be ahead of its competitors. Protecting it becomes a top priority. Due to this, most of the time it is given to entities within the group. The burden to establish the genuineness of the payment and the arm&rsquo;s length price of the same is much heavier than many other transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to determine arm&rsquo;s length conditions for the use or transfer of intangibles it is important to consider as part of the comparability and functional analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>the identification of specific intangibles;</li>\r\n	<li>the identification of the party(ies) that should be entitled to retain the return derived from the use or transfer of the intangibles;</li>\r\n	<li>the nature of the controlled transactions and whether they involve the use of intangibles and/or lead to&nbsp; the transfer of intangibles between the parties; and</li>\r\n	<li>the remuneration that would be paid between independent parties for the use or transfer of such intangibles.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In India payment of royalty has been one of the most litigated issues under transfer pricing. There have been several decisions by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to payment of royalties, MNEs often enter into agreements allowing use of brands, trademarks, know-how, design, technology etc. by their subsidiaries or related parties in India. Such payments can be in a lump sum, periodical payments or a combination of both types of payments. It is an internationally agreed position that intellectual property, which is owned by one entity and used by another entity, generally requires a royalty payment as consideration for the use. However, the important issue in this regard is the determination of the rate of royalty. The main challenge in determining the arm&rsquo;s length royalty rate is to find comparables in the public domain with sufficient information of the type required for comparability analysis. The Indian experience suggests that it is impossible to findcomparable arm&rsquo;s length prices in most cases. The use of the Profit Split Method as an alternative is generally not a feasible option due to the lack of requisite information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian tax administration has noticed serious difficulties in determining the rate of royalty charged for the use of brands and trademarks in certain cases. In some cases the user had borne significant costs in promoting the brand/trademark, and to promote and develop customer loyalty for the brand/trademark in a new market. In these cases, the royalty rate charged by the MNE will depend upon the cost borne by the subsidiary or related party to promote the brand and trademark and to develop customer loyalty for that brand and product. In many cases no royalty may be charged by, for example, the local subsidiary in the uncontrolled environment and the subsidiary would require arm&rsquo;s length compensation for economic ownership of marketing intangible developed by it and for enhancing the value of the brand and trademark owned by parent MNEs in an emerging market such as India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many cases, Indian subsidiaries using the technical know-how of their parent company have incurred significant expenditure to customize such know-how and to enhance its value by their R&amp;D efforts. Costs of activities, such as R&amp;D activities which have contributed in enhancing the value of the know-how owned by the parent company, are generally considered by the Indian transfer pricing officer while determining the arm&rsquo;s length price of royalties for the use of technical know-how.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian transfer pricing administration has also noted significant transfer pricing issues in cases of co-branding of a new foreign brand owned by the parent MNE (a brand which is unknown to a new market such as India) with a popular Indian brand name. Since the Indian subsidiary has developed valuable Indian brands in the domestic market over a period of time, incurring very large expenditure on advertisement, marketing and sales promotion, it should be entitled to arm&rsquo;s length remuneration for contributing to increasing the value of the little known foreign brand through co-branding it with a popular Indian brand and therefore increasing market recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy Reading!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By- Raghav Gupta<br />\r\nPartner | Transfer Pricing<br />\r\nLegal Quotient Consultants<br />\r\nE: lq.raghav@gmail.com, legalquotient@gmail.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to http://www.caclubindia.com</p>\r\n','Transfer Pricing, Royalty, income tax, internaltional royalty payment','Transfer pricing issues relating to royalty payment','transfer-pricing-issues-relating-to-royalty-payment.html','2014-07-08 20:19:51'),(91,'Admin','Reporting of FDI in India through FC-GPR','<p>Under the Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) Scheme, investments can be made in shares, mandatorily and fully convertible debentures and mandatorily and fully convertible preference shares of an Indian company by non-residents. As we are aware about the fact that there are basically 2 entry routs for investment in India; first is Automatic route and second is Government approval route.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Automatic Route: Under the Automatic Route, the foreign investor or the Indian company does not require any approval from the Reserve Bank or Government of India for the investment.</li>\r\n	<li>Government Route: Under the Government Route, the foreign investor or the Indian company should obtain prior approval of the Government of India (Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance or Department of Industrial Policy &amp; Promotion, as the case may be) for the investment.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Simple meaning of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In simple words Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) means monetary investment made by non-residents or by foreign entity or enterprise into an Indian entity or enterprise. A non-residents or foreign entity or enterprise may purchase equity shares in Indian companies, Indian entity or enterprise to invest their funds In other words any non-resident investment in an Indian company is foreign direct investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meaning of Indirect Foreign Direct Investment (Indirect FDI)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Investment in Indian companies can be made both by non-resident (Foreign Entities) as well as resident Indian entities. Investment by resident Indian entities could again comprise of both resident and non-resident investment. Thus, such an Indian company would have indirect foreign investment if the Indian investing company has foreign investment in it. For more details regarding Indirect Foreign Investment kindly refer my Article available at the link below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indirect Foreign Investment or Downstream Investment in India</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulatory framework for Reporting of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign investment in India is governed by sub-section (3) of Section 6 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 read with Notification No. FEMA 20/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000, as amended from time to time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India is undertaken in accordance with the FDI Policy which is formulated and announced by the Government of India. The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India issues a &ldquo;Consolidated FDI Policy Circular &rdquo; on an yearly basis on March 31 of each year (since 2010) elaborating the policy and the process in respect of FDI in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest &ldquo;Consolidated FDI Policy Circular&rdquo; dated April 17, 2014 is available in the public domain and can be downloaded from the website of Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion.

This reporting to RBI is to be done, not later than 30 days from the date of receipt of money, in the Advance Reporting Form enclosed in Annex - 6. The Form for reporting can be downloaded from the Reserve Bank&#39;s website link as given below: http://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BSViewFemaForms.aspx</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please find below relevant points in this regard:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Submission of FIRC evidencing receipt of Money: Indian companies are required to report the details of the receipt of the amount of consideration for issue of shares / convertible debentures/ warrants, through an AD Category - I bank, together with a copy of Foreign Inward remittance certificate (FIRC) evidencing the receipt of the money.&nbsp; KYC report about the non-resident investor from the overseas bank remitting the amount is also required to be attached with FIRC. The report would be acknowledged by the Regional Office concerned, which will allot a Unique Identification Number (UIN) for the amount reported.<br />\r\n	It is relevant to note that document FIRC defines the purpose of receipt of foreign money in India. Hence purpose of FIRC should be in sync with the transaction.</li>\r\n	<li>Time frame within which shares have to be issued: After receipt of money and reporting of the same through filing of FIRC, it is duty of the Indian Company to issue equity shares / convertible debentures / preference shares, as the case may be, within 180 days from the date of receipt of the inward remittance or by debit to the NRE/FCNR (B) /Escrow account of the non-resident investor.</li>\r\n	<li>Refund of Investment amount: In case, the equity instruments are not issued within 180 days from the date of receipt of the inward remittance or date of debit to the NRE/FCNR (B) account, the amount of consideration so received should be refunded immediately to the non-resident investor. This amount may be refunded either:<br />\r\n	1. by outward remittance through normal banking channels; or<br />\r\n	2. by credit to the NRE/FCNR (B)/Escrow account, as the case may be.</li>\r\n	<li>Provisions related to non-compliance: Non-compliance with the above mentioned FDI provision would be considered as a serious contravention of FEMA rules and regulations and could attract penal provisions under FEMA rules. However in exceptional cases, refund / allotment of shares for the amount of consideration outstanding beyond a period of 180 days from the date of receipt may be considered and condoned by the Reserve Bank, on the merits of the case.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reporting of issue of shares (Filing of form FC-GPR with RBI)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the discussion on timelines in case of Foreign Direct Investment, now it is time to discuss the form through the filing of which process of reporting of FDI to RBI is performed.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Filing of form FC-GPR: </strong>After issue of shares / convertible debentures / convertible preference shares/warrants, the Indian company has to file Form FC-GPR, through its AD Category I bank, not later than 30 days from the date of issue of shares. The Form can also be downloaded from the Reserve Bank&#39;s website. Please find below the relevant link: http://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Forms/PDFs/AP110214_ANN.pdf</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Non-compliance </strong>with the above provision would be reckoned as a contravention under FEMA and could attract penal provisions.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Annexures to be filed</strong> along with Form FC-GPR: Form FC-GPR has to be duly filled up and signed by Managing Director/Director/Secretary of the Company and submitted to the Authorised Dealer of the company, who will forward it to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank.

The OECD defines the term &ldquo;intangible&rdquo; as<br />\r\n&ldquo;something which is not a physical asset or a financial asset, and which is capable of being owned or<br />\r\ncontrolled for use in commercial activities&rdquo;. This term remained undefined under the Indian tax laws<br />\r\nfor a long time. By an amendment introduced in 2012 the term &ldquo;intangible property&rdquo; was defined in<br />\r\nthe Income-tax Act, which is quite broad in scope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Royalty is payment for the use of or right to use an intangible. Normally, an intangible is crucial for a<br />\r\ngroup when it attempts to be ahead of its competitors. Protecting it becomes a top priority. Due to this,<br />\r\nmost of the time it is given to entities within the group. The burden to establish the genuineness of the<br />\r\npayment and the arm&rsquo;s length price of the same is much heavier than many other transactions.<br />\r\nIn order to determine arm&rsquo;s length conditions for the use or transfer of intangibles it is important to<br />\r\nconsider as part of the comparability and functional analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) the identification of specific intangibles;<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) the identification of the party(ies) that should be entitled to retain the return derived from the use<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or transfer of the intangibles;<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iii) the nature of the controlled transactions and whether they involve the use of intangibles and/or<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lead to the transfer of intangibles between the parties; and<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iv) the remuneration that would be paid between independent parties for the use or transfer of such<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; intangibles.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In India payment of royalty has been one of the most litigated issues under transfer pricing. There<br />\r\nhave been several decisions by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT).<br />\r\nWith regard to payment of royalties, MNEs often enter into agreements allowing use of brands,<br />\r\ntrademarks, know-how, design, technology etc. by their subsidiaries or related parties in India. Such<br />\r\npayments can be in a lump sum, periodical payments or a combination of both types of payments. It is<br />\r\nan internationally agreed position that intellectual property, which is owned by one entity and used by<br />\r\nanother entity, generally requires a royalty payment as consideration for the use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, the&nbsp;important issue in this regard is the determination of the rate of royalty. The main challenge in<br />\r\ndetermining the arm&rsquo;s length royalty rate is to find comparables in the public domain with sufficient<br />\r\ninformation of the type required for comparability analysis. The Indian experience suggests that it is<br />\r\nimpossible to findcomparable arm&rsquo;s length prices in most cases. The use of the Profit Split Method as<br />\r\nan alternative is generally not a feasible option due to the lack of requisite information.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Indian tax administration has noticed serious difficulties in determining the rate of royalty<br />\r\ncharged for the use of brands and trademarks in certain cases. In some cases the user had borne<br />\r\nsignificant costs in promoting the brand/trademark, and to promote and develop customer loyalty for<br />\r\nthe brand/trademark in a new market. In these cases, the royalty rate charged by the MNE will depend<br />\r\nupon the cost borne by the subsidiary or related party to promote the brand and trademark and to<br />\r\ndevelop customer loyalty for that brand and product. In many cases no royalty may be charged by, for<br />\r\nexample, the local subsidiary in the uncontrolled environment and the subsidiary would require arm&rsquo;s<br />\r\nlength compensation for economic ownership of marketing intangible developed by it and for<br />\r\nenhancing the value of the brand and trademark owned by parent MNEs in an emerging market such<br />\r\nas India.<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In many cases, Indian subsidiaries using the technical know-how of their parent company have<br />\r\nincurred significant expenditure to customize such know-how and to enhance its value by their R&amp;D<br />\r\nefforts. Costs of activities, such as R&amp;D activities which have contributed in enhancing the value of<br />\r\nthe know-how owned by the parent company, are generally considered by the Indian transfer pricing<br />\r\nofficer while determining the arm&rsquo;s length price of royalties for the use of technical know-how.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Indian transfer pricing administration has also noted significant transfer pricing issues in cases of<br />\r\nco-branding of a new foreign brand owned by the parent MNE (a brand which is unknown to a new<br />\r\nmarket such as India) with a popular Indian brand name. Since the Indian subsidiary has developed<br />\r\nvaluable Indian brands in the domestic market over a period of time, incurring very large expenditure<br />\r\non advertisement, marketing and sales promotion, it should be entitled to arm&rsquo;s length remuneration<br />\r\nfor contributing to increasing the value of the little known foreign brand through co-branding it with a<br />\r\npopular Indian brand and therefore increasing market recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Royalty payment','Transfer pricing issues relating to royalty payment','transfer-pricing-issues-relating-to-royalty-payment.html','2014-10-13 13:32:39'),(102,'Admin','Reporting of FDI in India through FC-GPR','<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>Indirect Foreign Investment or Downstream Investment&nbsp;in India</strong>&rdquo; the meaning<span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">and procedure for Indirect Foreign Investment or&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Downstream Investment keeping in view the guidelines of RBI.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) Scheme, investments can be made in shares, mandatorily<br />\r\nand fully convertible debentures and mandatorily and fully convertible preference shares of an Indian<br />\r\ncompany by non-residents.

Investment by resident Indian entities could again comprise of both resident<br />\r\nand non-resident investment. Thus, such an Indian company would have indirect foreign investment if<br />\r\nthe Indian investing company has foreign investment in it. For more details regarding Indirect Foreign<br />\r\nInvestment kindly refer my Article available at the link below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Indirect Foreign Investment or Downstream Investment in India</strong><br />\r\nRegulatory framework for Reporting of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)<br />\r\nForeign investment in India is governed by sub-section (3) of Section 6 of the Foreign Exchange<br />\r\nManagement Act, 1999 read with Notification No. FEMA 20/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000, as<br />\r\namended from time to time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in India is undertaken in accordance with the FDI Policy which is<br />\r\nformulated and announced by the Government of India. The Department of Industrial Policy and<br />\r\nPromotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India issues a &ldquo;Consolidated FDI<br />\r\nPolicy Circular &rdquo; on an yearly basis on March 31 of each year (since 2010) elaborating the policy and<br />\r\nthe process in respect of FDI in India.<br />\r\nThe latest &ldquo;Consolidated FDI Policy Circular&rdquo; dated April 17, 2014 is available in the public domain<br />\r\nand can be downloaded from the website of Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Department of<br />\r\nIndustrial Policy and Promotion.

This reporting to RBI is to be done, not later than 30 days from the date of receipt of<br />\r\nmoney, in the Advance Reporting Form enclosed in Annex - 6. The Form for reporting can be<br />\r\ndownloaded from the Reserve Bank&#39;s website link as given below:<br />\r\nhttp://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BSViewFemaForms.aspx</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Please find below relevant points in this regard:</strong><br />\r\n1. Submission of FIRC evidencing receipt of Money: Indian companies are required to report the<br />\r\ndetails of the receipt of the amount of consideration for issue of shares / convertible debentures/<br />\r\nwarrants, through an AD Category - I bank, together with a copy of Foreign Inward remittance<br />\r\ncertificate (FIRC) evidencing the receipt of the money. KYC report about the non-resident investor<br />\r\nfrom the overseas bank remitting the amount is also required to be attached with FIRC. The report<br />\r\nwould be acknowledged by the Regional Office concerned, which will allot a Unique Identification<br />\r\nNumber (UIN) for the amount reported.<br />\r\nIt is relevant to note that document FIRC defines the purpose of receipt of foreign money in<br />\r\nIndia. Hence purpose of FIRC should be in sync with the transaction.<br />\r\n2. Time frame within which shares have to be issued: After receipt of money and reporting of the<br />\r\nsame through filing of FIRC, it is duty of the Indian Company to issue equity shares / convertible<br />\r\ndebentures / preference shares, as the case may be, within 180 days from the date of receipt of the<br />\r\ninward remittance or by debit to the NRE/FCNR (B) /Escrow account of the non-resident investor.<br />\r\n3. Refund of Investment amount: In case, the equity instruments are not issued within 180 days<br />\r\nfrom the date of receipt of the inward remittance or date of debit to the NRE/FCNR (B) account, the<br />\r\namount of consideration so received should be refunded immediately to the non-resident investor.<br />\r\nThis amount may be refunded either:<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. by outward remittance through normal banking channels; or<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. by credit to the NRE/FCNR (B)/Escrow account, as the case may be.<br />\r\n4. Provisions related to non-compliance: Non-compliance with the above mentioned FDI provision<br />\r\nwould be considered as a serious contravention of FEMA rules and regulations and could attract penal<br />\r\nprovisions under FEMA rules. However in exceptional cases, refund / allotment of shares for the<br />\r\namount of consideration outstanding beyond a period of 180 days from the date of receipt may be<br />\r\nconsidered and condoned by the Reserve Bank, on the merits of the case.<br />\r\nReporting of issue of shares (Filing of form FC-GPR with RBI)<br />\r\nAfter the discussion on timelines in case of Foreign Direct Investment, now it is time to discuss<br />\r\nthe form through the filing of which process of reporting of FDI to RBI is performed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Filing of form FC-GPR: After issue of shares / convertible debentures / convertible preference<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; shares/warrants, the Indian company has to file Form FC-GPR, through its AD Category I bank,<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; not later than 30 days from the date of issue of shares. The Form can also be downloaded from<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; the Reserve Bank&#39;s website.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNon-compliance with the above provision would be reckoned as a contravention under FEMA and<br />\r\ncould attract penal provisions.<br />\r\na. Annexures to be filed along with Form FC-GPR: Form FC-GPR has to be duly filled up and<br />\r\nsigned by Managing Director/Director/Secretary of the Company and submitted to the<br />\r\nAuthorised Dealer of the company, who will forward it to the concerned Regional Office of the<br />\r\nReserve Bank. The following documents have to be submitted along with Form FC-GPR as<br />\r\nannexures:<br />\r\ni. A certificate from the Company Secretary of the company certifying that :<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a.

Rule 37BB of the Income Tax Rules, 1962<br />\r\nstipulates detailed requirements in this regard. It has prescribed form 15CA to be submitted by the<br />\r\npayer and form 15CB in which, a certificate is to be given by a chartered accountant. Instead of the<br />\r\naccountant&rsquo;s certificate, a certificate from the assessing officer under Section 197 of the Act or an<br />\r\norder from the assessing officer under sub sections (2) or (3) of Section 195 are also acceptable.<br />\r\nAs most of us are aware, post notification No. SO 2659 (E) dated 2 September 2013 issued by the<br />\r\nCBDT, new form 15CB is in force. Vide this notification, Rule 37BB has been amended whereby it<br />\r\nstipulates the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. In case amount being paid does not exceed INR Fifty thousand and aggregate of such payments<br />\r\nmade during the financial year does not exceed INR Two lakh fifty thousand, the person paying<br />\r\nthe amount has to just provide with information in Part A of form 15CA without obtaining any<br />\r\ncertificate from a chartered accountant or assessing officer;<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. In case of payments other than those mentioned in &lsquo;a&rsquo; above, the payer has to provide with<br />\r\ninformation in Part B of form 15CA after obtaining certificate from a chartered accountant in<br />\r\nform 15CB or certificate/ order from the assessing officer, as the case may be.<br />\r\nSub Rule (2) of Rule 37BB stipulates that the information in Form No. 15CA shall be furnished by the<br />\r\nperson electronically to the website designated by the Income-tax Department and thereafter signed<br />\r\nprintout of the said form shall be submitted to the authorised dealer, prior to remitting the payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Major contents of form 15CB</strong><br />\r\nI presume that he readers would be conversant with format of the revised form 15CB now and hence<br />\r\nhave not discussed clause wise requirements hereunder. Instead, I have attempted to clarify issues<br />\r\nsurrounding applicability of TDS and rates thereof.<br />\r\nWhile determining applicability of TDS in the given transaction, please check nature of transaction<br />\r\nwith supplier invoice/ copy of agreement, if any. If based on its nature, the remittance is not taxable in<br />\r\nIndia at all (for e.g., reimbursement of travelling expenses), since it does not accrue or arise in India<br />\r\nunder Section 9, nor is it deemed to be received in India under Section 5, state the same accordingly<br />\r\nunder &ldquo;relevant section of the Act&rdquo; in form 15CB. In that case, even though the receiver does not have<br />\r\na PAN in India or a Tax Residence Certificate (TRC) from a foreign government, no TDS will be<br />\r\napplicable. In such case, no Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) needs to be invoked</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In case the transaction is taxable under Income Tax Act, applicability of DTAA benefit needs to be<br />\r\nchecked. According to Section 90 (4) of the Act, no DTAA benefit will be available to a non-resident<br />\r\nunless he/ she/ it produces a TRC issued by government of a foreign country/ territory. Even after<br />\r\nproducing TRC, DTAA benefit may not necessarily be available. One also has to check if the payee<br />\r\n(non-resident) has a PAN in India. If he does not have a PAN in India, Section 206AA (1) will be<br />\r\napplicable and tax shall be deductible at the higher of the following rates:<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i. rate specified in the relevant provision of this Act; or<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ii. rate or rates in force (i.e., as per DTAA); or<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;iii. at the rate of twenty per cent.<br />\r\nSection 206AA (1) will apply notwithstanding the payee furnishing TRC to the payer. In such case,<br />\r\nDTAA benefit cannot be availed. Thus, to avail benefit under DTAA, both, TRC of the non-resident<br />\r\nand his PAN in India must be available.<br />\r\nIn case tax is required to be deducted at source at a rate specified in the Act, the payer should add<br />\r\neducation cess also to the TDS amount, unlike in case of resident payees where no education cess<br />\r\nneeds to be added to TDS (except on salary). Please refer second page of the link<br />\r\n<strong>http://incometaxindiapr.gov.in/incometaxindiacr/contents/tpp/TDS-Rates-ENGLISH.pdf. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though&nbsp;rates given in the link are for the FY 2012-13, there is no change in substantive law that I am<br />\r\ndiscussing about.<br />\r\nThe position will, however, be different if the payee takes benefit of DTAA. In that case, no education<br />\r\ncess will be applicable on TDS amount, as held by ITAT, Kolkata in DIC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. V/s<br />\r\nAssistant Director of Income Tax (2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If TDS is applicable, the payer must have deducted and paid the same to the government account<br />\r\nbefore requesting a certificate in form 15CB. Chartered Accountant issuing the certificate should<br />\r\nverify copy of challan for payment of TDS. He has to mention proposed date of payment, date of<br />\r\ndeposit of tax and date of certificate. It has to be noted that the certificate is issued after depositing the<br />\r\ntax with government account but before remitting funds to non-resident. Thus, date of certificate<br />\r\ncannot be before date of depositing tax and cannot be after proposed date of payment.

In Companies Act 2013, provisions related to appointment of Director to fill up casual vacancy are<br />\r\nregulated by Section 161(4) of the Companies Act, 2013.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Only Public companies or Private companies which are subsidiary of Public Companies can fill the<br />\r\ncasual vacancy created in the office of Director under Section 161(4) of the Companies Act, 2013. In<br />\r\ncase casual vacancy created in a Private Company, the has to be filled in the General Meeting only<br />\r\nread with Section 152(2) of the Companies Act, 2013. In other words the board of directors of a<br />\r\nPrivate Company has no authority to fill the casual vacancy in the office of Director.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. A casual vacancy in the office of a Director may, in default of and subject to the provisions of the<br />\r\narticles of the company, be filled by the Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board. To fill up a<br />\r\ncasual vacancy prior authorization from Articles is not required just like Alternate or Additional<br />\r\nDirector. In case Articles are silent regarding appointment of director to fill casual vacancy, board of<br />\r\ndirectors have inherent power to fill the resulting casual vacancy under section 161(4).<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Filling up of casual vacancy through resolution by Circulation (Section-175) is not allowed as<br />\r\ncasual vacancy is compulsorily to be filled at the meeting of the Board of Directors of a Public<br />\r\nCompany.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5. As per the interpretation of the language of Section 161(4), vacancy in the office of a Director, who<br />\r\nwas appointed by the Company in General meeting, can only be filled as a Casual Vacancy under<br />\r\nsection 161(4). In simple words if casual vacancy created in the office of a Director who was<br />\r\nappointed in Board meeting, that vacancy cannot be filled under section 161(4). For example if an<br />\r\nadditional director appointed by Board vacated his office thereby creating casual vacancy, such casual<br />\r\nvacancy cannot be filled under section 161(4) of the Companies Act 2013.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Tenure of casual director: The person so appointed will be eligible to act as a casual director till<br />\r\nthe remaining tenure of the director in whose place he was appointed by the company.<br />\r\nSecretarial Procedure for filling up of casual vacancy</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please find below the procedure for appointment of Director to fill the casual vacancy in Board<br />\r\nMeeting as per Companies Act, 2013:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Check whether Articles of the Company contain any provisions to appoint Director to fill the casual<br />\r\nvacancy read with Section 161(4) of the Companies Act, 2013. If yes, than follow the provisions<br />\r\ngiven in Articles to fill the casual vacancy.<br />\r\n2. If Articles are silent about filling up of casual vacancy, than hold a board meeting to appoint a<br />\r\nDirector to fill the casual vacancy.<br />\r\n3. Collect DIN number of the proposed director u/s 153 read with from DIR-3 and DIR-4.<br />\r\n4.

It is a relief by way of refund/ recoupment of custom and excise duties paid on inputs or raw materials and service tax paid on the input services used in the manufacture of export goods.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Duty drawback provisions are given under section 74 and 75 of the Customs Act, 1962. Section 74 allows duty drawback on re-export of duty paid goods. Whereas section 75 allows drawback on imported goods used in the manufacture of export goods. In order to facilitate the drawback procedures, the Central Government is empowered to make rules. Pursuant to such power, the Central Government has issued two rules, i.e., Re-export of Imported goods (Drawback of Custom Duties) Rules, 1995 and Customs and Central Excise Duties and Service Tax Drawback Rules, 1995.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Drawback on re-export of duty paid goods under Section-74</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Section 74 of the Act grants duty drawback upto 98% of the import duty paid on goods, if the goods are re-exported by the importer. The importer is entitled to drawback subject to the fulfilment of the following conditions:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Goods are imported into India by making payment of customs duty;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. Goods are identified to the satisfaction of the Assistant or Deputy Commissioner of Customs as the goods, which were originally imported;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c. Goods have entered for export either on a shipping bill through sea or air, or on a bill of export through land, or as baggage, or through post and the proper officer should have permitted clearance of the goods for export;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d. Goods are entered for export within two years from the date of payment of import duty (period can be extended on sufficient grounds being shown). It is to be noted that the time limit of two years has to be considered from the date of payment of import duty. Hence, it does not mean the date of importation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Central Government vide the powers conferred under section 74, has notified the Re-export of Imported goods (Drawback of Custom Duties) Rules, 1995. These rules prescribes the procedure for claiming drawback and procedure for claiming drawback on re-exports by Post and through other modes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Rate of Drawback</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As regards to the rate of drawback, the Central Government is empowered to fix the rate having regard to the duration of use, depreciation in value and other relevant circumstances prescribed by a notification. In this behalf, the Government has issued notification no.19/65 dated 6-02-1965 as amended. As per this notification, drawback is not permissible for certain specified goods, such as wearing apparel, tea chests, exposed cinematographic films passed by Film Censor Board, unexposed photographic films, paper and plates and x-ray films. Also, in respect of motor vehicles imported for personal and private use the Drawback is calculated by reducing the import duty paid according to the laid down percentage for use for each quarter or part thereof, but upto maximum of four years.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Following table enumerates the reduced rate of duty drawback having regard to the duration of use:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 56px; width: 45px;\">\r\n			<p><strong>Sl.No.</strong></p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 56px; width: 510px;\">\r\n			<p><strong>Length of period between the date of clearance for home consumption and the date when the goods are placed under Customs control for export</strong></p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 56px; width: 89px;\">\r\n			<p><strong>Percent of drawback</strong></p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 28px; width: 45px;\">\r\n			<p>1</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 28px; width: 510px;\">\r\n			<p>Not more than 3 months</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 28px; width: 89px;\">\r\n			<p>95%</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 19px; width: 45px;\">\r\n			<p>2</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 19px; width: 510px;\">\r\n			<p>More than 3 months but not more than 6months</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 19px; width: 89px;\">\r\n			<p>85%</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 45px;\">\r\n			<p>3</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 510px;\">\r\n			<p>6- 9 months</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 16px; width: 89px;\">\r\n			<p>75%</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 14px; width: 45px;\">\r\n			<p>4</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 14px; width: 510px;\">\r\n			<p>9-12 months</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 14px; width: 89px;\">\r\n			<p>70%</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 11px; width: 45px;\">\r\n			<p>5</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 11px; width: 510px;\">\r\n			<p>12- 15 months</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 11px; width: 89px;\">\r\n			<p>65%</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 19px; width: 45px;\">\r\n			<p>6</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 19px; width: 510px;\">\r\n			<p>15-18 months</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 19px; width: 89px;\">\r\n			<p>60%</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 15px; width: 45px;\">\r\n			<p>7</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 15px; width: 510px;\">\r\n			<p>More than 18 months</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n			<td style=\"height: 15px; width: 89px;\">\r\n			<p>Nil</p>\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">Drawback on imported materials used in the manufacture of export goods under Section-75</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Drawback under section 75 is different from drawback under section 74. As per section 75, Central Government is empowered to allow duty drawback on export of goods, where the imported materials are used in the manufacture of such goods. Unlike drawback of a portion of the customs duty paid on imported goods, here the main principle is that the Government fixes a rate per unit of final article to be exported out of the country as the amount of drawback payable on such goods. Presently, these rates are of two types, viz., ALL INDUSTRY RATE and BRAND RATE. Further, the drawback amount depends upon the following factors:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Mode of manufacture,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. Quantum of raw material required,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. Average content of duty paid articles in the final product,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d. Standardisation of final product conforming to these norms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It is important here to note that Drawback is also eligible when imported materials and / or excisable materials are used in the manufacture of goods to be exported. Such provisions are given under Customs, Central Excise Duties and Service Tax Drawback Rules, 1995 [Drawback Rules]. The Central Government have framed the Drawback Rules, pursuant to the powers given under Section 37 of the Central Excise Act, 1944. According to such rules, drawback is eligible for both customs duty as well as excise duty, subject to the non availment of Cenvat credits. However, duty drawback of customs component is eligible irrespective of whether exporter has availed of Cenvat or not.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Importance of shipping bill for claiming duty drawback</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shipping bill is an essential document for claiming duty drawback. In case of exports under e-Shipping bill, the Shipping bill itself is regarded as claim for duty drawback. Whereas in case of manual export, the triplicate copy of the Shipping bill is treated as the drawback claim. Further, there are certain other formalities and documents required apart from the Shipping bill.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Non applicability of Drawback scheme</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Duty Drawback is not allowed in the following cases as per the Rule 3 of the Drawback Rules:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. if the said goods, except tea chests used as packing material for export of blended tea, have been taken into use after manufacture;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. if the said goods are produced or manufactured, using imported materials or excisable materials or taxable services in respect of which duties or taxes have not been paid; or;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c. on jute batching oil used in the manufacture of export goods, namely, jute (including Bimlipatam jute or mesta fibre), yarn, twist, twine, thread, cords and ropes;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d. if the said goods, being packing materials have been used in or in relation to the export of -</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;iii. jute manufactures not elsewhere specified (including Bimlipatam jute or mesta fibre) in which jute predominates in weight.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. if the drawback entitlement is less than `.50/- [Sec-76(1)(c) of the Customs Act, 1962]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. if the market price of export goods is less than the amount of drawback due thereon [Sec-76(1)(b) of the Customs Act, 1962]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;c. if product is manufactured partly or wholly in bond under section 65 of the Customs Act, 1962 because the duty drawback is not admissible in case of goods manufactured from duty free inputs</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;d. if the product is manufactured and exported by a 100% EOU in terms of the relevant Import policy; However, as per para 6.11 of FTP 2009-14, in case of deemed exports, if the DTA supplier does not claim export benefits, then the EOU/EHTP/STP/BTP Unit shall be eligible to claim such benefits</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;

This financial benefit is in addition to the other benefits given under Foreign Trade Policy [FTP]. However, drawback is not allowed when the assessee opts for Advance Authorisation scheme [i.e., purchase of inputs without payment of duty]. Therefore, it is advisable to analyse all the beneficial options before choosing any particular option.</span></p>\r\n','Customs act 1946, Drawbacks','Concept of Duty Drawback','concept-of-duty-drawback.html','2014-10-20 12:08:21'),(109,'Admin','Service Tax Compliance under Reverse Charge - Proprietorship','<p><strong>1. &nbsp; Freight paid/payable to Goods Transport Agency (GTA)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1.1 When does an individual/proprietorship firm is liable to pay service tax under reverse charge?</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">An Individual or a proprietorship firm is liable to take service tax registration and pay service tax under reverse charge only if:-</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i.

Packing the packing material itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The very basic requirement is Form C. Now, we try to analyse few of the common issues faced by the dealers with respect to issue of Form C and possible solutions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Which form to be submitted with the department?</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Form C has been prescribed in Original, duplicate and triplicate forms. Now the question arises which form to be submitted with the department as the CST Act or CST Rules do not prescribe anything in this regard. In case of Manganese Ore (India) Ltd Vs. CST MP (1991), the honourable High court held that filing of duplicate copy of form is enough compliance for claiming the concessional rate benefit. Contrary to this, there are decisions wherein it has been held that filing of Original form C is essential to claim the benefit. However, as every state has its own rules for compliance under CST law, it is essential to refer to respective rules in this regard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">What if Form C is lost? &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It may so happen that the Form C is lost by the purchasing dealer or it is lost when in transit to selling to selling dealer. &nbsp;In this case, the purchasing dealer should furnish an indemnity bond to the VAT/sales tax authorities from whom the forms are obtained. Such indemnity bond shall be in Form G specified. It is essential to note that it is not even possible to submit certified photocopy of earlier certificate as such photocopy is not acceptable as held by tribunal in case of J N Jetiwa v. state of Maharashtra- (1995) 11 MTJ 491 (Mah Trib). &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Whether selling dealer liable for false declaration by buyer?</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The purchasing dealer can issue C form for purchase of only those goods which are mentioned in his registration certificate. For other goods no Form C can be issued by the buyer. If the buyer so issues the form for goods not mentioned in the registration certificate, then it would result in misuse of form by the buyer and such buyer would only be liable for penalty under the CST provisions. Once selling dealer furnishes necessary declaration forms obtained from purchasing dealer, nothing more is required to be done as held by the High court in case of K G Industries v. STO (1999) 113 STC 49 (MP HC).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Whether Form C is applicable in case of Works contract also?</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Goods used in executing works contract are deemed to be sold and there is sale of material used in the execution of works contract. Hence, form C be issued for materials used in works contract also. However, again it is subject to listing of goods in the registration certificate of the buying dealer as held by the High court in case of United Ltd. v. CTO (1991) 83 STC 207(AP HC).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Whether Form C could be rejected for minor defects?</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Sometimes there could be minor errors in the Form C issued by the buying dealer to selling dealer which could be wrong date, wrong name of dealer etc. In such cases, the forms cannot be rejected by the dealers. There are numerous decisions which have upheld this view and as per most of the decisions the dealers shall be given an opportunity to rectify such mistakes in the forms. In Rajsthan Pipes v. CTO (2004) 138 STC 383 (Cal HC), the honourable High court held that the benefit cannot be denied on ground of omission like date of registration and minor variation in amount.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Conclusion:</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">There is a great hope that all these petty issues would be addressed and done away with the introduction of GST soon. However, till the introduction of GST the dealers shall be careful in handling transactions covered statutory forms like Form C, F which otherwise could lead to unnecessary waste of time, energy and even money most of the times.</span></p>\r\n','CST Act 1956, Tax at concessional rates 2%','Issues in issue of Form C under CST Act 1956','issues-in-issue-of-form-C-under-CST-Act-1956.html','2014-10-20 12:20:42'),(112,'Admin','Concept of Contemporaneous Documentation in Transfer Pricing','<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Contemporaneous documentation means information, records and other documents which exist or brought into existence at the time the taxpayer is developing or implementing any arrangement that might raise transfer pricing issues. It is important that documentation on which assessee is placing reliance to establish arm&rsquo;s length price should be the one which was available when the transaction was entered into between parties or latest by the time analysis was made and not created afterwards. In India the regulations provide that documentation must be existing latest by due date of filing form 3CEB is to be submitted with the return of income which contains the details of international transactions, transfer price as per books and arm&rsquo;s length price computed by the methods selected by the taxpayer. The documents which were relied for computing arm&rsquo;s length price or making comparability of transactions should be available by that date.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The concept of contemporaneous documentation is used in the transfer pricing regulations of many countries. Sub-rule (4) of rule 10D provides that information and documents should as far as possible, be contemporaneous and available latest by the specified date which is the due date of filing return of income. The words &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; used in the rule means that unless there are exceptional circumstances the documentation cannot be created at any available later date for evidentiary purpose. For example, if the taxpayer relies on the terms and conditions of a contract for provision of services, the contract must be entered into when the transaction is made or before due date of return. Any agreement made to support the transaction after due date even though given effect from earlier date cannot be regarded as contemporaneous documentation. The contemporaneous documentation can be in form of books, records, studies, budgets, plans, etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some countries like Spain and UK follow OECD guidelines. Para 5.15 of OECD guidelines, 2010 provide that tax administrators should limit the amount of information that is requested at the time of filing the tax return. This rule also therefore, recommends existence of documentation till the date of filing tax returns.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The requirement to keep and maintain contemporaneous data can sometime give rise to issues which are beyond the control of the taxpayer. The information and data of comparable uncontrolled transactions may not always be available in public domain till the specified date prescribed in law. But such data would be available to the tax authorities at the time when transfer pricing assessment or audit is undertaken. In such a situation it may be difficult for the taxpayer to comply with legal requirement of maintaining contemporaneous documents by specified date. The board therefore, should issue guidelines providing for conditions to relax rules for maintaining contemporaneous documentation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As per proviso to sub-rule (4) of rule 10D when an international transaction continues to have effect over more than one previous year, fresh documentation need not be maintained in respect of each year unless there is significant change in the nature of terms of international transaction. This provision is exception to the general rule that assessee must have contemporaneous documents and record of international transaction to establish arm&rsquo;s length price. The fresh documents are not considered necessary in case of same transaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This issue was examined by Delhi Tribunal in case of Airtech (P) Ltd. Vs Dy. CIT. The assessee engaged in the business of manufacture of designer furniture made supply of goods of INR 30.24 crores to its subsidiary company in UK. The transfer price of goods in the books was accounted as per cost plus method. During assessment proceedings the assessee was asked to furnish information and documents as prescribed in section 92D(1) and transfer pricing study report to support the claim that international transactions were made at arm&rsquo;s length price. The assessee did not furnish any supporting documents or transfer pricing study report as in its view such documents were not required when there was long term contract to supply goods by way of export at cost plus method. The tribunal held that exception to the rule of contemporaneous documentation is applicable only when international transaction continues to have effect over two or more years. In this case the assessee had not produced any agreement that may show the terms had binding effect from year 1996 onwards. Moreover, the market conditions also kept on changing from year to year. Thus there was no merit in the argument that margins charged in year 1996 should be considered as fair margins in the later years. Accordingly, it was held that proviso to rule 10D(4) was not applicable in the facts of the case and the assessee was required to maintain necessary documents for the relevant years under consideration.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Waiver from Documentation requirement</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sub-rule (2) of rule 10D(1) provides that prescribed documentation requirements shall not apply where the aggregate value, as recorded in the books of accounts, of international transaction entered into by the assessee does not exceed one crore rupees. As per proviso to this rule if value of international transactions is less than rupees one crore, the assessee must be able to substantiate, on the basis of material available with him, that income arising from international transactions has been computed as per arm&rsquo;s length price. Therefore, even though taxpayers covered under this rules are exempted from maintaining prescribed documents and information they have to keep some records / data to establish that their transfer prices are as per principle of arm&rsquo;s length price provided in section 92 of the act.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Roc Filing, Section 92 of the act.','Concept of Contemporaneous Documentation in Transfer Pricing','concept-of-contemporaneous-documentation-in-transfer-pricing.html','2014-10-20 12:43:23'),(113,'Admin','Cenvat implication on Sales rejection','<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It is normal that, excise duty paid goods are received back into the factory on account of , not needed presently, rejected, &nbsp;etc..

Ltd., Singapore (&ldquo;MO&rdquo;) to provide various technical support services to further the interest of MO &amp; maximize the markets for Microsoft products (&ldquo;the Services&rdquo;) in India, Bhutan, Nepal and Maldives. The Appellant was treating the Services as export of services (under Business Auxiliary Service under Section 65(105)(zzb) of the Finance Act, 1994) in terms of Rule 3(1)(iii) of the Export Rules in as much as the Services has been used by the persons located abroad for their business and the payment have been received in convertible foreign exchange. Therefore, the Appellant has not paid any Service tax on such revenue/ income received from MO.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Department contended that the Services cannot be considered as export of services as the Appellant was performing the Services in India which were used in India for furtherance of business of MO.

All India Federation of Tax Practitioners Case [2007 (7) STR 625 (SC)] (&ldquo;AIFTP case&rdquo;).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Hon&rsquo;ble Member (J) held that &quot;meaning of export pre-supposes taking out of India to a place outside India; Article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution explains what &quot;export&quot; means. Such concept was incorporated into Customs Act, 1962 in term of section 2(18) thereof. The activity of &quot;taking out of India to a place outside India&quot; is recognized test to hold an activity to be export. Activity relating to goods being equal to the activity relating to service, following &quot;Principles of Equivalence&quot;, meaning of the term &quot;export&quot; recognized by Constitutional provision and tested by law relating to Central Sales Tax, Customs, Central Excise and Export and Import Policy....&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">On the other hand, the Hon&rsquo;ble Member (T) observed, &quot;The word &quot;export&quot; in Article 286 in the Constitution is used with reference to goods. So is the case with definition of &quot;export&quot; in section 2(18) of the Customs Act, 1962. It will obviously need some dovetailing in the context of export of service which issue has come up only after 1994. It is this dovetailing that is being achieved through Export of Service Rules, 2005 and the criteria laid down in the Rules are neither arbitrary nor inconsistent with any provision in the Constitution. The issue being dealt with in the Rules is that whether taking out of India should be decided with reference to the situs of the property or the situs of the activity or the situs of the person receiving the service. It is difficult to conceive of taking the service and crossing the border&quot;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Consequently, the matter was referred to be decided by a third Member of the Hon&rsquo;ble Tribunal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Held:</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hon&rsquo;ble CESTAT, Delhi by majority view held the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">- The marketing operations done by the Appellant in India cannot be said to be at the behest of any Indian customer.

Before going into the nitty-gritty of the provision ,it would be appropriate to examine its legislative intent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Legislative Intent</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&bull; The legislative intent of the provision in the Act has not been expressly stated, contrary to normal convention particularly when a new provision or a statute is introduced. Be that as it may, it is obvious that the objective of the Section is to impose fetters on the provision of loans/ Guarantees to directors / companies in which they are interested in the manner contemplated in the Section, which was earlier permissible under Section 295 of the Companies Act, 1956(hereinafter &ldquo;the old Act&rdquo;) albeit, with the approval of the Central Government. It must be understood that the Section intends to regulate only provision of loans to directors or persons/ companies and other non-corporate entities in which the directors of the lending company are interested both directly and through their relatives. Its purpose is &nbsp;to ensure that the directors do not misuse their position to benefit themselves by facilitating provision of loans /financial guarantees from the Companies with which they are associated either to themselves or to entities in which they are interested.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The underlying objective of Section 185 is to ensure that the instrumentality of the Company is not perpetrated to any form of abuse by the Directors. The Section is intended to evidently avoid a conflict of interest and can thus be termed as a &ldquo;conflict of interest provision&rdquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; It is pertinent to note that the intent of Section 185 is not to regulate inter- corporate loans . Section 186 in the Act is intended to regulate Inter-corporate loans and investments. This Section acts as a composite code by itself and is therefore independent of section 185.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; Section 185 dissected</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Section 185 commences with the words &ldquo;Save as otherwise provided in the Act&rdquo;. The meaning of the above expression needs to be firstly understood. It &nbsp;contemplates that except where it is otherwise permitted under the Act, &nbsp;the fetter imposed by Section 185 as far as grant of loans to Directors will prevail, given the fact that the provision is in the nature of a specific provision .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &bull; Section applies to every company</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Section universally applies to all types of Companies, be it private or public .This is &nbsp;perfectly justified , considering its objective.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Application to loans given both &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Section puts an embargo on loans or other kinds of accommodation provided whether directly or indirectly under some kind of a subterfuge. Therefore any form of &ldquo;round &nbsp;tripping&rdquo; to circumvent the provision is strictly to be abhorred.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Loan includes &ldquo;Book Debt&rdquo; also</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The term &ldquo;loan&rdquo; is being given an extended connotation in the Section to cover any book debts due from a Director. This suggests that if any amount is due from a Director say, by way of rent against accommodation taken by him from the Company or against the value of goods supplied to him by the company on credit, it would tantamount to a &ldquo;loan&rdquo; and the outstanding will have to be necessarily squared off by the Director to ensure that it does not come within the ambit of the Section. Any &ldquo;Book Debts&rdquo; of the genre stated above which pre-existed prior to the coming into force of the Section has also been effectively drawn into the vortex of the Section, effective September 12,2013.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Provision of Guarantee or Security barred</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Section also comes in the way of the company providing any guarantee or any &nbsp;security in respect of a loan obtained by the Director from any other person.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Exceptions carved out by the Proviso to the Section</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Provision&nbsp;under sub-section (1) lays down the exemption clause of the Section. The provision of any loan to the Managing Director or whole time director is insulated &nbsp;from the rigors of the section provided the same has been given as part of the conditions of service extended to all the employees of the company or is pursuant to any scheme approved by the members by special resolution. It follows from the above that the company cannot extend any loan to a non- executive Director and further the loan facility should be extendable to all the employees of the Company. Alternatively, the loan should be extended pursuant to any scheme which has the approval of the members by special resolution.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The second limb of the proviso exonerates a company which, in the ordinary course of its business , provides loans or guarantees subject to the condition that the interest charged on the loan is at a rate which is not less than the bank rate declared by the RBI. The question that springs to mind from the above is whether a company belonging to the above category can provide loans to its directors under the shelter of this proviso. The answer would appear to be &ldquo;yes&rsquo; as long &nbsp;as the interest charged is in keeping with the rate stipulated above. Secondly it would indeed be in the ordinary course of it business to lend to any entity including its Directors subject to their credit worthiness being satisfactory. It should be ensured however that if loans are provided to its Directors, the same terms as applicable to other borrowers should be applied, lest the company should fall foul of section 185.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Coverage of Section</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Explanation under Section 185 (1) provides the canvas to the provision and amplifies the expression &rdquo;to any other person in whom director is interested&rdquo; to mean:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (a) Any director of the lending company, of a company which is its holding company or any partner or relative of any such director;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (b) Any firm in which the such director or relative is a partner;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (c) Any private company of which any such director is a director or member;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Any body corporate at a general meeting of which not less than 25% of the total voting power maybe exercised or controlled by any such director or two or more of such directors, together;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (e) Any body corporate, the Board of directors, managing director or manager, whereof is accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of &nbsp;the Board, or of any director or directors, of the lending company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As may be observed from the above Explanation, its tentacles are intended to extend far and wide. Its ramifications therefore run deep. A plain reading of Clauses (a) and (b) above suggests that these clauses put fetters on the provision of any loan to the director of a lending company, the Director of its Holding company or to any partner or relatives of such a director as also to any firm in which such a Director, namely the director of the lending company or the Director of the holding company or his relative is &nbsp;a partner. Thus the conflict of interest in the above two clauses can arise either through the direct interest of the concerned Director or through his relatives. The term &ldquo;Relative&rdquo; &nbsp;shall carry the meaning given to it by Section by 2(77) in the Act. The extension to the term &ldquo;Relative&rdquo; as provided in clause (iii) in section 2(77) may be found in Rule 4 of the companies(Specification of Definitions Details)Rules,2014.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Clauses (c), in the Explanation ibid, envisages only a situation where the Director is involved directly in his individual capacity. Therefore the provision of any loan to a private company in which such a director is a Director or member would be hit by clause (c), if the interest of the Director in the Private company is in the capacity of a member</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">. Even if his shareholding in the private company is minuscule, the above Clause (c) shall become applicable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Clause (d) contemplates that where any loan is to be provided to a company in which 25% or more of the total voting power in General meeting is exercisable or controlled by such a director either individually by himself or together by two or more directors of the lending company, the provision of the loan or security shall be barred. It is pertinent to note that clause (d) considers control or exercise of voting power over 25% of the total voting power of the borrower company in General Meeting. Such control over the voting power can be through the direct holding of the Director himself or may be by two or more directors of the lending company. In either situation the exercise of voting power should be by the directors in their individual capacity and not indirectly. Control over voting power indirectly through relatives, partners etc. does not fall within the ambit of clause (d). It would be also appropriate at this juncture to draw a distinction &nbsp;between the use of the expression &ldquo;control&rdquo; as contained in Section 2(27) of the Act and in clause (d) to the Explanation in Section 185. The definition of &ldquo;control&rdquo; in section 2(27) is much wider and it encapsulates exercise of control over the Management of a company, by exercise of the authority to appoint majority of directors or to control the management or policy decisions, exercise of shareholding rights .in the company. The usage of the word &rdquo;controlled&rdquo; in clause (d) above is in an altogether different context.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Further clause (d) above is restricted in application only to the extent of exercise of control over 25% or more of the total voting power exercisable in General Meeting</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The word &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; in Clause (d) is used in the form of a verb with reference to 25% of the voting rights of a company at general meeting, as against which &rsquo;control&rsquo; in Section 2(27) is used in the form of a noun to connote control over a company, be it through exercise of voting rights or management rights or shareholders&rsquo; agreement or in any other manner. Thus the term &ldquo;control&rdquo; as used in section 2(27) and in the above clause (d) are not to be considered as synonymous with each other.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As conventionally, only Equity shares of a company carry voting rights, in our view, the reference to the total voting power as stated in clause (d) should be only to Equity shares. It is common knowledge that in a General Meeting, voting power is exercisable only by the holders of Equity shares. Therefore unless the circumstances laid down in</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Section 87 (2) in the 1956 Act which corresponds to Section 47 in the Act come into play, voting rights bestowed through holding of preference shares are not to be taken into consideration in determining the threshold voting power laid down in clause (d). It is again reiterated that the voting rights in Clause (d) will have to be considered only on the basis of the direct holding of the directors of the concerned company or its holding company. Indirect holdings through relative, firms etc. shall not be considered as the above Clause (d) clearly states that the voting power shall be exercised by &ldquo;such director&rdquo; or by &ldquo;such directors&rdquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Supreme court in Ombalika Das and another -vs- Hulisa Shaw (2002) 4SCC 539 had occasion to explain the intent in the usage of the adjective &rdquo;such&rdquo; in legal parlance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Apex Court opined that the adjective &rdquo;such&rdquo; when prefixed to a noun has to be read in the same sense as is attributable to it in the preceding part of the sentence. Going by this analogy, it may be stated that a company cannot advance loan or provide security or guarantee to a company limited by shares, in which more than 25% of the voting rights is exercised by the director(s) of the lending company or either singly or together with two or more Directors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Clause (e) in the Explanation to section 185 comes into play where the Body corporate, the Board of directors, the Managing Director or Manager of the company seeking the borrowing are accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of the Board or of any director or directors of the Lending company. The expression &ldquo;Accustomed to act in accordance with the directions or instructions of the Board or of any Director or Directors of the lending company&rdquo; clearly suggests that it has to be circumstantially proved or established by a series of events or as may be explicitly provided by any agreement or documents, that the directors have acted in accordance with the directions or instructions of any director or directors or the Board of the lender company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In order to prove the above, it must be established that the directors of the borrower company do not exercise any discretion or judgment of their own, but act in accordance with the directions of the director(s)/Board of the Lender Company. It would be appropriate at this juncture to refer to a decision in Hydrodam(Corby) Ltd. Re, (1994) 2 BCLC 180, where it was held that where a parent company gave its sanction to a subsidiary for the disposal of the subsidiary&rsquo;s assets, this would not make the parent company a shadow director of the subsidiary. The sanction was given by the holding company in the capacity of a majority shareholder and not a controller from behind. As long as the decision was made by the directors of the subsidiary, exercising their own independent discretion and judgment, and the parent company only approved &nbsp;or authorized the decision, the parent company would not be considered as a shadow director.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Evidence such as the existence of an agreement between the lender and the borrower companies in terms of which there is an express assertion that the Borrower company shall abide by the directions of the Directors of the Lender company would be pointer in that direction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The decision of the Bench in Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Vs. Becker (2003) 1 BCLC 555, that, to show that a person is a shadow director, it &nbsp;must be proved that de jure directors followed a consistent pattern of compliance with the instructions of the shadow director makes interesting reading. It must however be borne in mind that in this case, the Board was found to be working at the behest of a person who though not being part of the Board had all the trappings of being a de facto Director. We must point out that Clause (e) is restricted in application to only those who are de jure Directors and not de facto Directors which shadow directors are.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&bull; Clauses (d) and (e) in Explanation cover Companies incorporated outside India</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">It is also pertinent to point out that in both clauses (d ) and (e) in the Explanation cited above, the expression &rdquo;Body Corporate&rdquo; has been used in contrast to the earlier clauses (a) , (b) and (c ) where the reference is to a &ldquo;company&rdquo; .The term &ldquo;body corporate&rdquo; or &ldquo;corporation&rdquo; has been defined in Section 2(11) of the Act to include a company incorporated outside India. A co-operative society registered under any law relating to co-operative Societies and any other body corporate which is not a company as defined in the Act which the Central Government may by notification specify in this behalf do not come within the frame work of &nbsp;a &ldquo;body corporate&rsquo;&rsquo;. Thus the provision of loans and guarantees to companies incorporated outside India will also come within the ambit of the Section if the circumstances contemplated in clauses (d) and (e) exist.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&bull; Head note to the Section does not tell the full story</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Section 185 carries on the Statute Book, the head note &rdquo;Loans to Directors, etc.&rdquo; As one can see from our discussion this head note is somewhat misleading in that the fetter imposed by the Section extends not only to loans and guarantees extended to directors but also to companies and bodies corporate in which the circumstances enumerated in clauses (c ),(d) and (e) in the Explanation exist. Viewed from this perspective, the provision overlaps in a limited sense with Section 186 of the Act which as we have said in our elucidation is a composite code for regulating Inter-corporate loans and Investments.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&bull; Penalties for contravention</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Any contravention of the Section is intended to be dealt with very severely with cash penalties on both the company and the errant Directors and other persons to whom the loan/guarantee has been provided which is extendable up to Rs 25 lacs ,apart from imprisonment which may extend to six months or both. In case of imprisonment, the errant Director will also invite disqualification and vacation of office under Section 164 and 167 respectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Conclusion</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In our exposition we have endeavored to explain the law on the subject at length. What we consider conspicuous in the legislation is that if the provision of a loan or guarantee comes within the framework of the Section, there is no way that the same can be sanctified even through the process of Government approval in contrast to the predecessor provision in the 1956 Act. Secondly the Section applies to every company as opposed to Section 295 which did not apply to a private company unless it happened to be a subsidiary of a public company. Last but not the least is the fact that the section also includes &ldquo;pseudo loans&rdquo; in that it ropes in book debts due from a Director. Private companies which were profligate in the matter of providing loans to their Directors under the previous regime should be extremely wary of the pitfalls that lie ahead !.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Section 185 in the Companies Act 2013','Loans to Directors, etc. Applicability of Section 185 in the Companies Act,2013','loans-to-directors-applicability-of-section-185.html','2014-10-20 15:35:55'),(118,'Admin','Taxability of Interest Income of Non-Resident','<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">In this article, analysis is being done on Tax Rate applicable on Interest income to Non-resident.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The Tax Rates on interest income to non-resident is dependent upon following 3 crucial factors:-</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a.

Companies act 1956 does not deal with the amortization of intangible Assets but New Schedule by companies&rsquo; act 2014 provide the method to amortize them.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.

For other companies, useful life cannot be longer than what is prescribed in Schedule II.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. New act prescribed the residual value to be 5% of cost of asset, in older schedule there is no such prescription as but rates given by schedule are worked out by considering the 5% residual value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. New method for double shift and triple shift is prescribed under which addition depreciation of 50% or 100% will be allowed for double and triple shift respectively.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6. The concept of 100% depreciation of assets whose cost is less than Rs. 5000/- is deleted hence under new act it will be depreciated as per other normal provisions of schedule II.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.

The new Act has been divided into 29 Chapters comprising of 470 sections &amp; 7 Schedules as against the existing Companies Act, 1956 comprising of 658 Sections &amp; 15 Schedules. On one hand the new Act takes away some of the outdated procedures not relevant today such as the requirement to obtain a commencement of business certificate; provisions relating to the sole agents; requirement of qualification shares to be held by the Directors etc. At the same time it brings in various new contemporary provisions keeping in mind the need of the hour and the experience of last 50 years such as concept of One Person Company, Woman Director, Corporate Social Responsibility, Rotation of Auditors, preparation of consolidated financial statement, cash flow statement, ban on raising unsecured public deposits, strict penalty in case of corporate fraud, Board meetings through video conferencing, notices through electronic mails, maintenance of books of accounts in electronic mode etc. The Companies Act, 2013 also seeks to continue to increase the general momentum towards self-regulation as it has dispensed with the prior approval of Central Government on most of the matters.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">However a lot of provisions grabbing the highlights of discussion on the New Companies Act, do not impact a private limited company. At the same time there are a lot of subtleties hidden in sub-sections, definitions &amp; new rules that impact the corporate management &amp; compliance of a private limited company. The article seeks to discuss the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 along with Rules notified thus far applicable with respect to a private limited company in a comprehensive manner.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">General Provisions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1. Maximum Number of Members</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The same has been increased from 50 to 200 in case of a private limited company. Further the new Act has increased the limit on number of partners from 20 to 50 in a partnership. Minimum share capital required is Rs 1 lacs (Rs 5 lacs for a public company).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2. Certificate of Commencement of business [Sec 11(1)]:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no requirement of obtaining such a Certificate now. However, every company shall file the declaration in Form No.INC-21 &amp; the contents of the form to be verified by a CA/CS/CMA in practice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">3. Affixing name, registered office address etc. [Sec 12(3)]:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Every company shall paint or affix its name &amp; the address of its registered office, on the outside of every business place. Also it shall get its name, address of its registered office &amp; the Corporate Identity number along with telephone number, fax number, e-mail &amp; website address, if any printed in all its business letters, bill-heads, letter papers and in all its notices and other official publications. Further if the company has changed its name in the last 2 years, it shall paint/affix/print the former name along with new name.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">4. Subsidiary company not to hold shares in its holding company. [Sec 19]:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No company allowed to hold any shares in its holding company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">5.

Thereafter the Ministry adopted a Committee under the chairmanship of Dr. JJ Irani and the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations were considered in seminars held all over the company. We hope that the Government shall continue to work in the spirit of such consultation and shall look seriously upon various recommendations made by ICAI and industry on some of the new provisions.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n','Provisions of Companies Act, 2013','Applicability of Co.

The Companies Act, 2013 has brought in extensive changes with the objective to ensure and seek transparency and establish better corporate governance practices. This article is based on Understanding, Impact and Analysis of Deprecation provision which is in Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013. I hope that you will find this publication useful in understanding Deprecation provision of the Companies Act, 2013.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1. Key point for Depreciation under Schedule II of Companies Act, 2013 (Act 2013):</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1) The depreciation needs to be provided based upon the useful life as specified in Schedule II of companies Act, 2013.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2) In the Schedule II of companies Act, 2013, useful life of Plant and Machinery bifurcated into General Plant and Machinery and Special Plant and Machinery (Industry in Specific like glass manufacturing industries, Telecommunications industries, Refining industries, power generation and distribution industries, steel manufacturing industries etc )</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Defined its residual value cap. Ordinarily, the residual value of an asset is often insignificant but it should generally be not more than 5% of the original cost of the asset.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong>Accounting Standard 6</strong>:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">As per Para 13 of Accounting Standard 6, The statute governing an enterprise may provide the basis for computation of the depreciation. For example, the Companies Act, 1956,(now to say the companies Act, 2013) lays down the rates of (now to say Useful life for) depreciation in respect of various assets. Where the management&rsquo;s estimate of the useful life of an asset of the enterprise is shorter than that envisaged under the provisions of the relevant statute, the depreciation provision is appropriately computed by applying a higher rate (now any change in useful life of asset which is not as per Schedule II then justification should be given)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2.

Before going through the procedure it is necessary to understand about the concept of One Person Company and the advantages expected after conversion of Private Company into One Person Company (OPC).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Concept of One Person Company (OPC) (Section &ndash; 3)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The concept of One Person Company (OPC) is a new concept of business. The Companies Act, 2013 has recognized this concept. Now sole-Proprietor form of business may convert themselves into corporate form of business with less compliances and formalities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Some features of One Person Company form of business are:</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Only one shareholder required for formation of One person Company. However this one person must be a natural person with Indian citizenship.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Only one Director required for formation of One person Company. One Person Company (OPC) can have maximum 15 Directors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Shareholder and Director can be same person.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. Appointment of Nominee through Memorandum is must.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Such nominee shall give his/her consent before being appointed as Nominee.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6. Only a natural person, who is an Indian citizen and resident in India shall be a nominee for the sole member of a One Person Company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7. One Person Company (OPC) cannot convert voluntarily into any kind of company unless two years have expired from the date of incorporation of One Person Company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8. However in case paid up share capital is increased beyond Rs.50 Lakhs or average annual turnover exceeds Rs.2 Crores, then the One Person Company (OPC) shall ceased to be a One Person Company and has to initiate the process for conversion in to a Private or Public Company, with in a period of Six Months.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantages of One Person Company (OPC) Business form</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">1. Limited Liability</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">There may be various unforeseen events, beyond our control, during the course of business which can destroy the entire business and put personal assets of the proprietor at risk, in case form of business is proprietor ship business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">However, in case of a One Person Private Limited Company, the liability of a shareholder is limited to the extent of his/her shareholding in the Company. As per corporate form of business any business loss will not affect personal property of the owner and it will be the Company which will bear the entire loss.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">2. Legal status with complete control</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Companies Act 2013 recognized the concept of One Person Company as a Private Limited business structure. As we all are aware that company form of business is a widely used business form and creates a confidences in parties doing business with the company. It is a simple fact to understand that any dealer, suppliers or customers feel more comfortable to deal with private limited companies as compare to proprietorship firm.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">One of the major advantages One Person Private Limited Company business form is that here owner is one person who can take quick decisions w.r.t. the business of the Company and enjoy complete control.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">3. Easy Banking Operations</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Banks also prefer companies for providing their services rather than proprietorship firm. It is comparatively easy for One Person Companies to get loan from banks rather than proprietorship firm. In short we can say that One Person Company is a successful substitute of proprietorship business.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">4. Taxation relaxation</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Companies Act 2013, have given ample powers to One Person Company to run its business as a Company and enter into valid business contract with customers and management. Thus all the provisions of tax planning are available to a One Person Company.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.

What do you interpret by this section whether first period is six years or five years so my dear friends it is neither five or six year it is the duration between 5 consecutive AGMs.For example Mr X is appointed as auditor of XYZ ltd in its first AGM now he will retire on 6th AGM. &nbsp;In companies act 1956 it was only one agm. In case of government company CAG shall appoint auditor with in 180 days form the close of the end of the relevant financial year. However members may ratify such appointment in every AGM.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Now companies are also require to obtain the written consent of auditor and certificate stating that conditions like ceiling, qualification etc. regarding appointment are complied with. Company is also required to inform to auditor and also the registrar with in 15 days, whereas in old companies act company was only required to inform the auditor of his appointment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Listed companies are required to rotate (please note here word is rotation not retire) the auditor in every five years not in five AGM and if auditor is audit firm the same is 2 terms of five years. Further proviso of this subsection state that no firm having common partners to other audit firm ,whose tenure has expired in company, shall be appointed auditor of the company.In my opinion the firm like big fours can beat this section easily because they have made firm with different &nbsp;name they can retire any common partner in the firm before the date of appointment hence they will get outside the scope of these provisions. To cope up with this ICAI has issued guidelines that companies cannot appoint a new firm as auditor if it is part of the same network as retiring firm. This provision will remove familiarity threat.this may stop the fraud like Sattayam &nbsp;Also as new &nbsp;auditor will not aware of the business of the company this will increase the cost of audit. Basically this section was introduced to give chance to new entrants but due you think companies like TCS RILetc will hire new CAs as its stat auditor.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Anyway moving to the next company which is required to comply with this sub section shall comply with in 3 year from the date of commencement of his act.This gives two views</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- An auditor who has completed the seven years of serves will be removed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Second view is as I have earlier said in companies act 1956 appointment was for a period between two agms and companies act 2013 speak about the two term so the requirement will apply prospectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">For banking companies RBI requires the rotation of auditor in every four years whereas irda require rotation in every five years in my opinion these provisions should prevail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Moving &nbsp;to the next member of company may pass a resolution that auditor will be rotated at such interval as may be resolved.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">First auditor of the company will be appointed by the board of director of the company with in 30 days in case of failure member of the company will appoint the auditor with in 90 days in EGM. however in case of government company CAG will appoint first auditor with in 30 days in case of failure board of director will appoint first auditor in further 30 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Moving to the casual vacancy it shall be filled by the board of director with in 30 days .in case casual vacancy is caused by resignation it shall also be approved by the member with in 3 months. Earlier if casual vacancy is caused by the resignation it shall be also be approved by the central government. In case of government company casual vacancy shall be filled by CAG with in 30 days in case of failure on the part of CAG vacancy shall be filled by board of director of the company.

Further before removal auditor concerned should be given reasonable opportunity of being heard. Earlier no approval of central government is required.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">If auditor resigns from the office he shall file statement with registrar and in case of Government Company also with the CAG.if auditor does not do so he shall be punishable with a fine fifty thousand to five lacs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Auditor has right to make representation and he may request to circulate the same with the notice of AGM if copy of representation is not send the same should be read at the meeting and the particular should also be filed with registrar.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Now if tribunal suo moto or on application of any person or central govt,forms an opinion that auditor is acting fraudulently and abetted in any fraud it may direct the company to remove the auditor it shall pass such an order with in 5 days and after that central govt. may appoint the auditor.

However position w.r.t. resignation by director made clear by Courts through various decisions. In Companies Act, 1956, there were various case laws which we used to refer regarding effective date of resignation for Executive Directors or Ordinary Directors or whether acceptance by Board required or not.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Under Companies Act, 1956, it was duty of the Company to file form 32 in case of change in board of directors under section 303(2) due to resignation by a director. No liability prescribed for the resigning Director to intimate Registrar of Companies about his/her resignation. Whenever a Director resigns from his position of Director, form 32 is to be filed by the Company with ROC within 30 days from the effective date of resignation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Position under Companies Act, 2013</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Position under Companies Act, 2013, was quite clear about the procedure of resignation of director.

INSERT INTO `events` (`id`, `title`, `description`, `start`, `url`, `tag`, `color`, `backgroundColor`) VALUES (7,'Accounts workshop','<p>Royalty payment has been a matter of intensive discussion in India as well as internationally. Recently, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published discussion paper on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) in which it is suggested that they are looking at developing &ldquo;rules to prevent BEPS by moving intangibles among group companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This will involve:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>adopting a broad and clearly delineated definition of intangibles;</li>\r\n	<li>ensuring that profits associated with the transfer and use of intangibles are appropriately allocated in accordance with (rather than divorced from) value creation;</li>\r\n	<li>developing transfer pricing rules or special measures for transfer of hard-to-value intangibles; and</li>\r\n	<li>updating the guidance on cost contribution arrangements.&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, identification of intangibles and payments therefore has assumed very high importance in the area of transfer pricing and international taxation. The OECD defines the term &ldquo;intangible&rdquo; as &ldquo;something which is not a physical asset or a financial asset, and which is capable of being owned or controlled for use in commercial activities&rdquo;. This term remained undefined under the Indian tax laws for a long time. By an amendment introduced in 2012 the term &ldquo;intangible property&rdquo; was defined in the Income-tax Act, which is quite broad in scope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Royalty is payment for the use of or right to use an intangible. Normally, an intangible is crucial for a group when it attempts to be ahead of its competitors. Protecting it becomes a top priority. Due to this, most of the time it is given to entities within the group. The burden to establish the genuineness of the payment and the arm&rsquo;s length price of the same is much heavier than many other transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to determine arm&rsquo;s length conditions for the use or transfer of intangibles it is important to consider as part of the comparability and functional analysis:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>the identification of specific intangibles;</li>\r\n	<li>the identification of the party(ies) that should be entitled to retain the return derived from the use or transfer of the intangibles;</li>\r\n	<li>the nature of the controlled transactions and whether they involve the use of intangibles and/or lead to&nbsp; the transfer of intangibles between the parties; and</li>\r\n	<li>the remuneration that would be paid between independent parties for the use or transfer of such intangibles.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In India payment of royalty has been one of the most litigated issues under transfer pricing. There have been several decisions by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to payment of royalties, MNEs often enter into agreements allowing use of brands, trademarks, know-how, design, technology etc. by their subsidiaries or related parties in India. Such payments can be in a lump sum, periodical payments or a combination of both types of payments. It is an internationally agreed position that intellectual property, which is owned by one entity and used by another entity, generally requires a royalty payment as consideration for the use. However, the important issue in this regard is the determination of the rate of royalty. The main challenge in determining the arm&rsquo;s length royalty rate is to find comparables in the public domain with sufficient information of the type required for comparability analysis. The Indian experience suggests that it is impossible to findcomparable arm&rsquo;s length prices in most cases. The use of the Profit Split Method as an alternative is generally not a feasible option due to the lack of requisite information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian tax administration has noticed serious difficulties in determining the rate of royalty charged for the use of brands and trademarks in certain cases. In some cases the user had borne significant costs in promoting the brand/trademark, and to promote and develop customer loyalty for the brand/trademark in a new market. In these cases, the royalty rate charged by the MNE will depend upon the cost borne by the subsidiary or related party to promote the brand and trademark and to develop customer loyalty for that brand and product. In many cases no royalty may be charged by, for example, the local subsidiary in the uncontrolled environment and the subsidiary would require arm&rsquo;s length compensation for economic ownership of marketing intangible developed by it and for enhancing the value of the brand and trademark owned by parent MNEs in an emerging market such as India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many cases, Indian subsidiaries using the technical know-how of their parent company have incurred significant expenditure to customize such know-how and to enhance its value by their R&amp;D efforts. Costs of activities, such as R&amp;D activities which have contributed in enhancing the value of the know-how owned by the parent company, are generally considered by the Indian transfer pricing officer while determining the arm&rsquo;s length price of royalties for the use of technical know-how.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Indian transfer pricing administration has also noted significant transfer pricing issues in cases of co-branding of a new foreign brand owned by the parent MNE (a brand which is unknown to a new market such as India) with a popular Indian brand name. Since the Indian subsidiary has developed valuable Indian brands in the domestic market over a period of time, incurring very large expenditure on advertisement, marketing and sales promotion, it should be entitled to arm&rsquo;s length remuneration for contributing to increasing the value of the little known foreign brand through co-branding it with a popular Indian brand and therefore increasing market recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy Reading!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By- Raghav Gupta<br />\r\nPartner | Transfer Pricing<br />\r\nLegal Quotient Consultants<br />\r\nE: lq.raghav@gmail.com, legalquotient@gmail.com</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to http://www.caclubindia.com</p>\r\n','2014-11-01','accounts-workshop.html','RoC-Filing','#f16829','#f16829'),(8,'Internal Audit','Internal audit detail','2014-11-11','internal-audit.html','Income-Tax','#195E4B','#195E4B'),(9,'Service Tax workshop','Service-Tax','2014-11-26','service-tax-workshop.html','Service-Tax','#0060E8','#0060E8'),(10,'Sales-Tax','Sales-Tax','2014-11-02','sales-tax-workshop.html','Sales-Tax','#A9005B','#A9005B'),(11,'Excise Duty Workshop','Excise-Duty','2014-11-03','excise-duty-workshop.html','Excise-Duty','#E80000 ','#E80000 '),(12,'Customs Duty Workshop','Customs-Duty','2014-11-19','customs-duty-workshop.html','Customs-Duty','#59009C','#59009C'),(13,'Other Workshop','Others','2014-11-12','other-workshop.html','Others','#820000','#820000'),(14,'Income Tax Workshop','Income-Tax','2014-11-12','income-tax-workshop.html','Income-Tax','#195E4B','#195E4B');
